# TheSnakeGame
an interactive installation experience that challenges players to contemplate the ethical dimensions of power, violence, and innocence, as well as the question of right and wrong in the shadow of power.

# Concept:

"The Snake Game" transforms the simplicity of the classic snake game into a profound metaphor for the complexities and moral dilemmas inherent in war crime regimes. It is an interactive installation experience that challenges players to contemplate the ethical dimensions of power, violence, and innocence, as well as the question of right and wrong in the shadow of power.

# Artistic Interpretation
A canvas of green and red dots is scattered across the screen. Victory is only achieved if the snake skillfully navigates through this colorful maze to eat only the red dots - However, the game is designed so that avoiding green dots is impossible, thus creating a moral dilemma.

- The Snake: Symbolizes dictatorship regimes, embodying the oppressive, unyielding nature of such powers.
- Red Dots: Represent the lies, propaganda, and justifications for violence used by these regimes.
- Green Dots: Symbolize innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of political propagandas and warfare.

The gameplay is designed to be impossible to play without harming the innocent, thus posing the question: 

Can the pursuit of what is perceived as evil ever justify the harm of innocents? 

This interactive installation uses the simplicity of the game to dive into the complexities of political power, violence, and morality. The Snake Game is a thought-provoking journey that invites players to explore the gray areas of morality in the context of political power and war, while challenging perceptions and evoking empathy for a goal of creating a safe, yet interesting space for dialog and discussion.

Old-school, pixelated, vintage style, which artfully represents the longstanding nature of these practices throughout time.
